# overthewire-bandit-notes

This repository contains my personal notes while solving the Bandit wargame from [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).

##  What is Bandit?

Bandit is a wargame that helps beginners learn Linux commands and terminal skills. Each level teaches you something new.

Notes are in [`bandit_notes.md`](./bandit_notes.md)

## What did I learn?

A summary of practical Linux and security concepts I picked up by playing [OverTheWire: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).

---

## Shell Basics
- Navigated directories using `cd`, listed files with `ls`
- Viewed file contents using `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`
- Worked with hidden files, symbolic links, and file types

---

## File & Directory Management
- Identified file types using `file`
- Located files with `find` (by name, type, size, permissions, user)
- Handled unusual filenames with spaces, symbols, or dashes
- Understood permissions using `ls -l`, `chmod`, `chown`

---

## Redirection & Filtering
- Redirected input/output with `>`, `>>`, `<`, and pipes (`|`)
- Used `grep`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `strings`, and `wc` for file parsing

---

## Command-Line Tools & Concepts
- Used tools like `xxd`, `base64`, `gzip`, `bzip2`, `tar` to decode files
- Decompressed and extracted archived files
- Reconstructed and reversed encoded content

---

## Scripting & Logic
- Chained commands with `&&`, `||`, `;`
- Applied command substitution with `` `command` `` and `$(command)`
- Used loops and pipelines to automate search and decode tasks

---

## Permissions & Privileges
- Understood file ownership: user vs group
- Explored SUID binaries and permission-based privilege escalation
- Practiced using `su`, `whoami`, and permission checks

---

## Networking & Ports
- Connected to remote services with `ssh`, `telnet`, and `nc` (netcat)
- Sent/received data over custom ports and sockets
- Learned basic concepts around networking and services

---

## Debugging & Problem Solving
- Used `reset`, `man`, and `--help` for troubleshooting
- Inspected environment with `env`, `set`, and custom scripts
- Practiced trial-and-error learning with curiosity

---

## Soft Skills
- Reading errors, researching, and iterating
- Practiced critical thinking, patience, and persistence
- Built foundational confidence in working on the Linux terminal

---

## Final Outcome
> I now have strong fundamentals in Linux, scripting, file systems, permissions, and networking basics. These skills support future work in Cloud, DevOps, or Security roles.
